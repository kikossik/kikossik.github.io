This project is the result of some cool research I did at Stony Brook University, guided by Dr. Halada (Materials Science) and Dr. Montgomery (Economics). I even got to mix it up with Dr. Mueller's Data Visualization class in Computer Science, so it became a mashup of everything I love about data science - bringing together different fields to tell a story with data!
