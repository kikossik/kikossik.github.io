title: "Does Climate Change Affect Oil & Gas Infrastructure?"
excerpt: "<em>Interactive Visualization, Data Processing, Conference Speaking</em><br/>d3.js, Python<br/><br/>This project is the result of some cool research I did at Stony Brook University, guided by Dr. Halada (Materials Science) and Dr. Montgomery (Economics). I even got to mix it up with Dr. Mueller's Data Visualization class in Computer Science, so it became a mashup of everything I love about data science—bringing together different fields to tell a story with data!<br/><img src='/images/test.png'>"

## Key accomplishments:
- Created an interactive dashboard highlighting high-risk geographical areas prone to damage, enabling material scientists to target these areas for developing anti-crack and corrosion-resistant coatings for the pipelines carrying Hazardous Liquids.
- Presented research at the SBU Economics Conference and showcased a poster for the [EACC VIP](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/vertically-integrated-projects/teams/_team_page/team_page.php?team=Engineering%20Adaptation%20to%20Climate%20Change%20(EACC)) team with Prof. Halada at the URECA Symposium.

### 1 - Data Cleaning
I got the data from [*Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)*](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/data-and-statistics-overview). Since it spans from 1986 to 2022, the format was inconsistent across three different Excel files, each with unique formatting. About 80% of my work involved data cleaning and preprocessing. I’ve attached my Jupyter Notebook file for anyone interested in exploring it further.  
As a side note, I also merged data on Temperature and Extreme Storm Events from 1986 to 2022 (sourced from [NOAA.gov](NOAA.gov)), as these factors are also susceptible to change due to climate change. Ultimately, this was not used in the visualization, but it's good I kept it since you can see more work inside the Notebook!
