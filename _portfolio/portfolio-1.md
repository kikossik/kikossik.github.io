title: "Does Climate Change Affect Oil & Gas Infrastructure?"
excerpt: "<em>Interactive Visualization, Data Processing, Conference Speaking</em><br/>d3.js, Python<br/><br/>This project is the result of some cool research I did at Stony Brook University, guided by Dr. Halada (Materials Science) and Dr. Montgomery (Economics). I even got to mix it up with Dr. Mueller's Data Visualization class in Computer Science, so it became a mashup of everything I love about data scienceâ€”bringing together different fields to tell a story with data!<br/><img src='/images/test.png'>"

## Key accomplishments:
- Presented at SBU Economics Conference and at Ureca VIP team 
- Developed dashboard to capture most affected/dangerous areas prominent to damage, which allows material scientists to focus on those areas to research building anti-crack/corrosion resisting material which can be coated on the pipes

### 1 - Data Cleaning
I got the data from *Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The format was very bad as the data is from 1986-2022. It consisted 3 different excel files, all of them with different type of formatting. 80% of my work was data cleaning and preprocessing. I will attach my Jupyter Notebook file for anyone who's interested to  take a look. Side note: in this Notebook I also merged data about Temperature and Extreme Storm Events from 1986-2022 (both data from *NOAA.gov*). Ultimately, this was not used in the visualization, but it's good I kept it since you can see more work inside the Notebook :)
